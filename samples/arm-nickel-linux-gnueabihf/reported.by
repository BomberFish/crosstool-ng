reporter_comment="Nickel on Kobo FW >= 4.6
This is specifically designed for stuff that needs to interact directly with Nickel,
i.e., it matches *perfectly* the current TC used by Kobo (Linux 4.0, Glibc 2.19, GCC 4.9).
Do *NOT* use to ship binaries for older FW versions.
Unless you have a specific need for this, prefer the the arm-kobo-linux-gnueabihf TC:
besides using a much saner and up to date GCC version,
it will also generate binaries working on much older FW versions."
